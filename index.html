							<center><h2>What is ADHD</h2></center>
							<center><p>ADHD is a neurological disorder characterized by a persistent pattern of inattention - with or without hyperactivity and impulsivity - that interferes with daily functioning.</p></center>
							<div class="features">

									<span class="icon solid major fa-surprise"></span>
									<h3>Potential Risks</h3>
									<p>untreated ADHD are at risk for low self-esteem, underachievement and problems like depression and anxiety</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-infinity"></span>
									<h3>Lasting Effects</h3>
									<p>Symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity are present since childhood.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-arrow-down"></span>
									<h3>Current Effects</h3>
									<p>Having ADHD can cause failures in communication (words get scrambled or they can interrupt people without thinking about it)</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-user-friends"></span>
									<h3>Society Impact</h3>
									<p>Gender norms may force girls to mask and hide symptoms of ADHD. Stereotypes around neatness, organization, cooperation, compliance, and social behaviors may encourage girls and women to deny or compensate for ADHD symptoms in classrooms and family structures.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-users-slash"></span>
									<h3>Effects of Society Impact</h3>
									<p>Because symptoms can be more subtle in girls, healthcare practitioners may be less likely to diagnose girls with ADHD unless they also show symptoms of emotional disorders</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon major fa-forward"></span>
									<h3>Future Effects</h3>
									<p>Multiple studies of girls with ADHD have shown that their self-esteem is often lower than boys with ADHD — even well into adulthood. They are also more likely to experience major psychological distress such as severe anxiety and depression. Chronic stress due to these issues can also lead to other conditions, such as fibromyalgia.</p>
